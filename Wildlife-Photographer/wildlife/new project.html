                            <p class="par-ed">Michael "Nick" Nichols (born 1952) is an American journalist, photographer and a founder of the LOOK3 Festival of the Photograph in Charlottesville, Virginia.Nichols began his photojournalism career in 1979, working for GEO magazine.Three years later he became a member of Magnum Photos where he worked until 1995.Starting from 1989 he has published more than 30 articles for the National Geographic and the same year was in collaboration with Jane Goodall to publish a book called Brutal Kinship. During Nicholsâ€™ time with National Geographic, his stories have covered subjects including old growth Redwoods, the worldâ€™s remaining tigers and the emotional relationship of the elephant family.His photo Surfing Hippos was named one of TIMEâ€™s Most Influential Images of All Time.
                                Later on, he traveled to Central Africa where he met with biologist J. Michael Fay and then went to Gabon where he visited 13 national parks, including the Ndoki forest which was featured in one of the NatGeo articles and in his The Last Place on Earth book.In 2012, he traveled to Tanzania on an assignment to document the life of lions in the Serengeti.
        
                                In November 2015, it was announced that Nichols would be one of around 180 lay-offs from National Geographic in the run-up to the magazine's acquisition by Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox.Having been a staff photographer there since 1996 and editor-at-large since 2008, Nichols explained in an interview that he was preparing to retire at the start of 2016, but expressed regret for other colleagues losing their jobs and that he did not understand why the staff cuts were deemed necessary.</p>

                        <h1>WILD</h1>
                        <h2>By NICK NICHOLS</h2>
                        <p class="par-ed">Enjoy the first book of a brand new series â€¦ WILD is famed wildlife photographer Michael Nicholsâ€™ choice of his favourite images. Presented in chronological order from the beginning of his career in 1980, when he used Transparency film and was a Magnum photographer, until 2016, when he had embraced digital capture as the editor at large of National Geographic magazine. Shown without words to explain the images, Nichols is asking the viewer to â€œlook and feelâ€œ.
    
                            As the orders for the first 500 copies came in, the photographer and the publisher did get together and produced the book. The books were printed and shipped across the Atlantic to Michaelâ€™s home for signing them. The next step was the binding process which is mostly handmade and took another three weeks.All copies of the whole print run were signed by Michael Nichols and include a special edition letter-sized print (8.3â€³Ã—11â€³ / 21Ã—28cm). Our Friends have a choice of three images.All copies of the whole print run were signed by Michael Nichols and include a special edition letter-sized print (8.3â€³Ã—11â€³ / 21Ã—28cm).
